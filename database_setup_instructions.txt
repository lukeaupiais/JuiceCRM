## Oracle ATP Database Setup

These instructions outline the steps to set up the Oracle ATP database for the project.

**1. Provision an Oracle ATP Instance:**
   - Log in to your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account.
   - Navigate to the Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) service.
   - Create a new ATP instance. Provide a database name, display name, and password.
   - Choose a workload type (Transaction Processing).
   - Configure the compute and storage resources for the ATP instance.

**2. Download the Client Credentials:**
   - After the ATP instance is provisioned, download the client credentials (e.g., `wallet.zip`).
   - This file contains the necessary certificates and configuration files to connect to the database securely.

**3. Configure Database Access:**
   - Configure network access to allow connections from the backend application.
   - You can use OCI Network Security Groups (NSGs) or Security Lists to control network traffic.

**4. Create Database User:**
   - Connect to the ATP instance using a SQL client (e.g., SQL Developer).
   - Create a new database user for the application.
     ```sql
     CREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED BY <password>;
     GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO <username>;
     ```

**5. Create Database Tables:**
   - Design the database schema based on the application requirements.
   - Create the necessary tables and indexes.
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
       <column_name> <data_type>,
       ...
     );
     ```

**6. Configure Database Connection in Backend:**
   - In the Python backend application, configure the database connection using the `oracledb` driver.
   - Provide the database connection string, username, and password.
   - Use the client credentials (wallet.zip) to establish a secure connection.


This setup provides a basic Oracle ATP database environment. Customize the setup further based on the specific needs of the project.
