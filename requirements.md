# Project Requirements

## 0. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Juice project. The project is aimed to develop a user-friendly, web-based application with AI-powered features to enhance customer support and sales efficiency. This document will serve as a reference throughout the development process. The goal is to create a user-friendly, web-based application with a simple and appealing UI/UX. The application should also have AI-powered features to enhance customer support and sales efficiency. It should be intuitive and intuitive. The application must be web-based and use a modern web-based framework. It needs an easy to use API for both outgoing and incoming data, and support a wide variety of possible integrations. The document should be clear and detailed and contain all the information. The file will be in the directory `C:/Users/aupia/Git/MegaTEAM/devteam/juice`. Also, I will update it as I gather more information. The document is very important to make sure it is accurate and complete.
