# JuiceCRM

***An open-source project dedicated to Multi-Agent System produced code***

## Idea

This is an open-source CRM that invites all to participate - with a single condition: only use Multi-Agent systems or autonomous AI to plan, write, execute, test and submit all changes. These changes shall also be reviewed by AI agents. The objective of this project is prove AI's ability to write functional applications and a basic CRM is a great test case for exploring this.

We recommend that you define your agents, tasks and tools as generic as possible to both produce good results and also be reproducable across many other applications.

Can AI produce reliable, usable, enterprise-level applications without direct human intervention? We shall find out...

## Tech Stack

Frontend: NextJS, TailwindCSS
Backend: Python
Database: PostgreSQL

***Additional Information:*** The progress.md, scope.md and roadmap.md serve as input files to the AI Agents to understand and carry out the tasks in a sequential and progressive order.
