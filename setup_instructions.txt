## Python Backend Development Environment Setup

These instructions outline the steps to set up the Python backend development environment for the project.

**1. Install Python:**
   - It is recommended to use Python 3.9 or higher. Check OCI's current supported runtimes for the latest recommendations.
   - Download the Python installer from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - During installation, make sure to add Python to your system's PATH environment variable.

**2. Create a Virtual Environment:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory (C:/Users/aupia/Git/MegaTEAM/devteam/juice).
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     ```

**3. Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows, run:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux, run:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

**4. Install Required Packages:**
   - Create a `requirements.txt` file in the project directory (C:/Users/aupia/Git/MegaTEAM/devteam/juice) with the following content:
     ```
     # Framework
     fastapi==0.103.0 # High-performance API framework
     uvicorn==0.23.2 # ASGI server for running FastAPI

     # Database interaction
     oracledb==1.3.1   # Oracle database driver (Thin mode)
     SQLAlchemy==2.0.21  # ORM for database interaction (optional)

     # API interaction
     requests==2.31.0  # For making HTTP requests
     httpx==0.25.0 # For making asynchronous HTTP requests

     # Data validation
     pydantic==2.3.0   # Data validation and settings management

     # Environment variables
     python-dotenv==1.0.0 # For loading environment variables
     ```
   - Run the following command to install the packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

**5. Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory (C:/Users/aupia/Git/MegaTEAM/devteam/juice) to store sensitive information such as database credentials and API keys.
   - Load the environment variables using the `python-dotenv` library.

**6. Address Potential Issues:**
   - **Cold Starts:** Consider using provisioned concurrency on OCI to mitigate cold start issues.
   - **Oracle Client Library Dependency:** Use `oracledb` in Thin mode to avoid the need for Oracle Client libraries.
   - **Database Connection Management:** Use connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections.


This setup ensures a proper development environment for the Python backend, facilitating interaction with Oracle ATP and third-party APIs, suitable for deployment on OCI Serverless Container.
