## MegaTEAM Juice Application - Frontend Setup Instructions

These instructions will guide you through setting up the frontend development environment for the MegaTEAM Juice Application.

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Node.js and npm:** Ensure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). After installation, verify that `node -v` and `npm -v` commands work in your terminal. If not, you may need to add the Node.js installation directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

**Setup Steps:**

1.  **Create React App:**
    *   Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory: `cd C:/Users/aupia/Git/MegaTEAM/devteam/juice/frontend`
    *   Create a new React application using: `npx create-react-app .` (The dot signifies the current directory. If you prefer another name, replace the dot).

2.  **Install Tailwind CSS:**
    *   Navigate into the project directory:
             `cd C:/Users/aupia/Git/MegaTEAM/devteam/juice/frontend`

    *   Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
        npx tailwindcss init -p
        ```

    *   Configure Tailwind to scan your template files:
    *Add the following lines to your `tailwind.config.js` file:
        ```javascript
        /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
        module.exports = {
          content: [
            "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
          ],
          theme: {
            extend: {},
          },
          plugins: [],
        }
        ```
    *   Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS:
        *   Add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwind’s layers to your `./src/index.css` file.
        ```css
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```


3.  **Initialize Git:**
    *   Initialize a Git repository in the project directory:
        ```bash
        git init
        ```
    *   Create a `.gitignore` file and add `node_modules` to it to exclude dependencies from version control.
    *   Add and commit the initial project files:
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial commit: React app setup with Tailwind CSS"
        ```

Now you have a basic React application set up with Tailwind CSS and Git initialized. You can start developing your frontend for the MegaTEAM Juice Application.
