## NextJS Frontend Development Environment Setup

These instructions outline the steps to set up the NextJS frontend development environment for the project.

**1. Install Node.js and npm:**
   - Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/). npm is included with Node.js.
   - It is recommended to use the latest LTS version of Node.js.

**2. Create a NextJS Application:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory (C:/Users/aupia/Git/MegaTEAM/devteam/juice).
   - Run the following command to create a new NextJS application:
     ```
     npx create-next-app@latest frontend
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to configure your NextJS application. You can choose to use TypeScript, ESLint, and other options.

**3. Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
   - Run the following command to navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```
     cd frontend
     ```

**4. Install Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install the project dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - You may need to install additional dependencies based on the project requirements. For example:
     ```
     npm install react react-dom next
     npm install axios # For making API requests
     npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material # For Material UI components
     ```

**5. Start the Development Server:**
   - Run the following command to start the development server:
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```
   - The development server will start at http://localhost:3000.

**6. Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory to store environment variables such as API endpoints and authentication tokens.
   - Access the environment variables in your NextJS application using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.


This setup provides a basic NextJS frontend development environment. You can customize the environment further based on the specific needs of the project.
